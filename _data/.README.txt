Datasets specs:

=== zzcards.cvs ===
A CSV dataset.
NOTE:
 * comma "," separated fields.  Remember to double-quote fields having "," (i.e RELATED)
 * Remove trailing blanc lines !!
Fields:
- ID      - the KEY, single word (only alfanumeric, no underscore, nor other chars)
- TITLE   - a short title
- INFO    - long description  (? unstructured ?)
- RELATED - (optional) sequence of ID (separated by 1 " ")

For each ID, we expect two images placed in the /_cards directory :
  <ID>.png   (large image)
  <ID>_t.png (thumbnail image)  * this is generated with pre-Jekill.tcl

** VERY IMPORTANT **
this dataset should be ordered by the ID field
